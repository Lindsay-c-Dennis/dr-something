## The Basics

The Dr. Something press page has a React/Redux front-end with a Rails API backend. Dr. Something is an independent singer/songwriter based in Portland, Oregon. The page allows users to stream Dr. Something songs and view select videos, as well as look through the artist's Sound Illustrated collection of sketches of other local musicians. The page also includes a review board where visitors can leave notes for the artist (with full CRUD functionality).
